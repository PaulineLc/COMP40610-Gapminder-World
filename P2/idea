On the TED Talk "The best stats you've ever seen" by Hans Rosling he says
"western world: long life, small family"
"third world: short life, large family"
Then he goes on and shows a graph where you see the country where bubble size = population; X=nb of kids; Y=lfe expectancy

One of my preconceived idea, which I think is shared by a lot of other people, is that:
- poor countries = large families (due to lack of access to medicine, contraception...)
- rich countries = small family (due to generalized to medicine, contraception...)

Is that true??

Idea:

show how the above has changed in the years
X = GDP
Y = Number of children
over the years
bubble color = ???


How does a country develop?
- decrease of agri
- Average number of children
- GDP mapped to size
